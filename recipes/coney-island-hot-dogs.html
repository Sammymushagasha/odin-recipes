        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The story of how the Coney Island hog dog got to the Midwest is pretty straightforward, 
           but no one really knows exactly how the wiener first came to be topped with what is basically 
           a hot meat relish. I have no idea how authentic this is and have never been to Detroit or even Flint. 
           I have had Nathan's version, which I enjoyed, but the word on the street is that it's not nearly
           as good as the relatives it spawned.</p>
