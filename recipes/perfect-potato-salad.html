        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>"This is my mother Pauline's recipe," says Chef John. 
            "It's pretty much a classic potato salad but remember, if you add onions, 
            use sweet onions and chop with a very sharp knife, 
            allow potatoes to cool to room temp before dressing them, and always taste for salt."</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>¼ cup kosher salt</li>
            <li>10 cups cold water</li>
            <li>½ cup finely diced celery</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely diced sweet onion (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>3 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives for garnish</li>
            <li>1 pinch paprika for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dressing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups mayonnaise, or more if needed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Place whole potatoes in a pot with 1/4 cup kosher salt. 
            Cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low. 
            Simmer until tender, about 40 minutes (depending on size). 
            Transfer cooked potatoes to a plate. Allow them to cool to room temperature.</li>

            <li>When potatoes are completely cooled, peel off the skin. 
                Cut into larger than bite-size pieces as the pieces will break down slightly 
                when you toss with the dressing. Transfer potato pieces to a mixing bowl. 
                Add celery, onions, parsley, chopped hard-boiled eggs. 
                Combine ingredients, breaking up larger pieces of potato.</li>

            <li>Place mayonnaise in mixing bowl. Add cider vinegar, mustard, 
                salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Whisk until well combined.</li>

            <li>Pour mayonnaise mixture onto potatoes; stir until well combined. Cover and refrigerate 
                until completely chilled, 2 to 3 hours. Taste for seasonings and texture. 
                Salad may need a bit more salt and another spoonful of mayonnaise.</li>
        </ol>
