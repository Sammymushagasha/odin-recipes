        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Your Fourth of July celebration requires juicy BBQ chicken with truly explosive flavor! 
            There are no cherries in this recipe, but it's undeniably the bomb. Actually, 
            the name comes from the brine, which features cherry tomatoes and hot habanera chilies, 
            all blended together into a smooth puree.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart cold water</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken, cut into 4 pieces</li>
            <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 habanero peppers, seeded</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons prepared Thai sweet chili sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Combine water, sugar, and kosher salt in a saucepan over low heat; 
                cook until sugar and salt dissolve, 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside until cooled to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Score skin sides chicken pieces 2 to 3 times, about ⅛-inch deep; 
                place in a large bowl or lidded container.</li>
            <li>Combine cherry tomatoes, habanero peppers, garlic, 
                and allspice with sugar and salt mixture in a blender; blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour tomato brine over chicken pieces, making sure all pieces are covered. 
                Cover bowl or container; refrigerate 4 to 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken pieces from brine, shaking off excess; 
                transfer to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. 
                Pat chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Discard brine.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high, indirect heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Combine oil, thyme, cumin, black pepper, 
                and cayenne pepper in a small bowl; brush onto chicken pieces</li>
            <li>Cook chicken over direct heat, skin sides down, on the preheated grill for 1 to 2 minutes; 
                flip chicken pieces and move to indirect heat. 
                Cook until well-browned and meat is no longer pink in centers, 30 to 35 minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted near 
                but not touching the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Brush chicken pieces with chili sauce; transfer to a plate and rest before serving for 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
